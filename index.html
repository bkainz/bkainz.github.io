<p>I am a Lecturer in the Department of Computing at Imperial College London. I am researching translational high-performance medical data analysis and interactive real-time image processing techniques. I am working with the <a href="http://biomedic.doc.ic.ac.uk/"">BioMedIA</a>  group and collaborate intensively with King's College London, <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/imaging/index.aspx">Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering</a>, St. Thomas Hospital London.<br>
In 2013 I moved to Imperial College London with a EU FP7 Marie-Curie Fellowship, working together with Prof. Daniel Rueckert and Prof. Jo Hajnal (KCL).  Since then I am supporting the EPSRC/Wellcome trust project <a href="http://www.ifindproject.com/">iFind</a> with high-performance computing methods.<br>
I finished my Ph.D.-Thesis within the field of medical visualization, volume graphics and GPU algorithms in the team of Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg at the <a href="http://www.icg.tugraz.at/">Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision at Graz University of Technology</a> , Austria in 2011. My research interests are the interconnection of medical image data acquisition, fast hardware accelerated medical image processing and interactive real-time visualization.
