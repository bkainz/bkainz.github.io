<p>I am Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Department of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a>. I am researching translational high-performance medical data analysis and interactive real-time image processing techniques as member of the <a href="http://biomedic.doc.ic.ac.uk/">Biomedical Image Analysis, BioMedIA</a> Group in the section of Visual Information Processing. I collaborate intensively with King's College London, <a href="http://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/imaging/index.aspx">Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering</a>, St. Thomas Hospital London and the department of <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/bioengineering">Bioengineering</a> at Imperial.<br>
In 2013 I moved from Graz University of Technology in Austria to Imperial College London with a EU FP7 Marie-Curie Fellowship, working together with Prof. Daniel Rueckert and Prof. Jo Hajnal (KCL). Since then I am also supporting the EPSRC/Wellcome trust project <a href="http://www.ifindproject.com/">iFind</a> with high-performance computing methods.<br>
I finished my Ph.D. in the field of medical visualization, volume graphics and GPU algorithms in the team of Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg at the <a href="http://www.icg.tugraz.at/">Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision</a> at Graz University of Technology in Austria. This shaped my research interests towards the interconnection of medical image data acquisition, fast hardware accelerated medical image processing and interactive real-time visualization.
