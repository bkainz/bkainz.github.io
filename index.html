<p>I am Reader in the <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/computing">Department of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> and full Professor at <a href="https://www.fau.eu/">Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</a> where I head the <a href="https://hds.tf.fau.eu/">Chair for Health Data Science</a>. 
<p>
My research is about intelligent algorithms in healthcare, especially Medical Imaging. I am working on self-driving medical image acquisition that can guide human operators in real-time during diagnostics. Artificial Intelligence is currently used as a blanket term to describe research in these areas.
<p>
Current research questions:
Can we democratize rare healthcare expertise through Machine Learning, providing guidance in real-time applications and second reader expertise in retrospective analysis?
Can we develop normative learning from large populations, integrating imaging, patient records and omics, leading to data analysis that mimics human decision making?
Can we provide human interpretability of machine decision making to support the ‘right for explanation’ in healthcare?
<p>
My teaching is focused on real-time computing, Machine Learning, Image Analysis, Computer Graphics and Visualisation.
