<p>Bernhard Kainz is a Lecturer at the Department of Computing at Imperial College London and Senior Research Fellow at King's College London, Division of Imaging Sciences and Biomedical Engineering, St. Thomas Hospital London. I am researching translational high-performance real-time medical data analysis and interactive visualization in the course of the iFind project and in collaboration with the BioMedIA group at Imperial. My  current research is about fetal MRI real-time image processing, high-performance computing, and visualization. In 2013 I came to Imperial College London with a EU FP7 Marie-Curie Fellowship, working together with Prof. Daniel Rueckert. I finished my Ph.D.-Thesis within the field of medical visualization, volume graphics and GPU algorithms in the team of Prof. Dieter Schmalstieg at the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision at Graz University of Technology, Austria in 2011. My research interests are the interconnection of medical image data acquisition, fast GPU accelerated medical image processing and interactive real-time medical visualization.<p>
