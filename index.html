<p>I am Professor at <a href="https://www.fau.eu/"> Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nuremberg</a> where I head the <a href="https://hds.tf.fau.eu/">Health Data Science group</a> and I am Reader (= US/EU Associate Professor++) in the <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bkainz/">Department of Computing</a> at <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/">Imperial College London</a> where I lead the <a href="http://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/bkainz/">human-in-the-loop computing group</a> and co-lead the <a href="https://biomedia.doc.ic.ac.uk/">biomedical image analysis research group (BioMedIA)</a>. We are a post-pandemic, borderless research group, across nations and institutions. 
<p>
Our research is about intelligent algorithms in healthcare, especially Medical Imaging. We are working on self-driving medical image acquisition that can guide human operators in real-time during diagnostics. Artificial Intelligence is currently used as a blanket term to describe research in these areas.
<p>
Our current research questions are:
<ul>
<li>Can we democratize rare healthcare expertise through Machine Learning, providing guidance in real-time applications and second reader expertise in retrospective analysis?</li>
<li>Can we develop normative learning from large populations, integrating imaging, patient records and omics, leading to data analysis that mimics human decision making?</li>
<li>Can we provide human interpretability of machine decision making to support the ‘right for explanation’ in healthcare?</li>
</ul>
<p>
My teaching is focused on real-time computing, Machine Learning, Image Analysis, Computer Graphics and Visualisation. 
<p>
I am a scientific advisor for <a href="https://thinksono.com/">ThinkSono</a> and <a href="https://www.cydarmedical.com/">Cydar Medical</a>.
